## How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

It was interesting to see how ideas seem to flow when working with a pair. We also had very similar design ideas which also helped with the colaborative part of our design.

## Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

Wireframing at first seemed to be a very laborous process. I found myself constantly editing my design because it just didn't feel complete. However, after designing the index page for all of our blog posts and then today designing this wireframe for each individual post helped to bring the process together for me. I was easily able to implement ideas from my previous wireframes and begin creating a sort of theme for the elements I wanted and the overall layout of the page.

## What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

We decided that a good wireframe consisted of a strong layout concept to streamline our process. Since we already had created our previous wireframes we found that after writing out the general sections we would both need that adding in our individual tweaks was fairly simple.

## What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?

A lot of the symantics we used were similar to what we've already used. Bringing in the new elements of html5 is still a work in progress and we're expecting our html syntax to change a lot as we learn more about these semantic elements.
