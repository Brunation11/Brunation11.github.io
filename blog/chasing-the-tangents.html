              <p>So phase-0 has been everything I've expected it to be and more. I've been inspired, motivated, challenged and utterly defeated. I've found myself humbled by my peers and everything that we've been able to learn from one another. Frankly, I'm humbled by just how much I don't know... That isn't to say that I'm not enjoying the experience, on the contrary, in today's day and age it's difficult to find this kind of stimuli. I would even go as far as to say that my biggest struggle is in processing all the information that's been thrown at me. I go off on tangents about 90% of the time, no really that's not an exaggeration, but that's because for the first time in a long time I've found myself in an environment conducive to my style of thinking.</p>

              <p>During week-0 of phase-0 we were asked to determine our thinking style based off of the Gregorc Thinking Style by Professor Anthony Gregorc. He defines these styles as Cocrete Sequential, Concrete Random Thinkers, Abstract Random, and Abstract Sequential. Of these, it would seem that I'm both a Concrete Sequential and Abstract Random thinker.</p>

              <p>Concrete Sequential thinkers tend to process information in an ordered linear way. The way I interpret it, this seems like an excellent explanation for my tangents. I've loved reading all the sources, so much so that if a source references another source I'll follow that, and so on and so forth. The topics we're learning about here are more than anything I could have expected, and it's this curiosity and hunger to learn that has me straying away from what a particular challenge might be asking of me.</p>

              <p>Whether you choose to think of it as a complement or complete contrast there's also the Abstract Random thinking style. Professor Gregorc describes these thinkers by their desire to organize information through reflection. They thrive in people oriented environments with minimal structure. This leads my to the most invaluable source of knowledge I've found here at DBC, my fellow cohort mates. It seems that for every bit of knowledge I pick up on my own, there's someone there sharing two new resource, or a new browser extension, I've even found myself inspired to do my own research and learn how responsive design works just because someone asked a question about frameworks.</p>

              <p>However you choose to interpret these thinking styles I can promise you one thing, they're here to stay. I'm not ready just yet to put a limit on my tangents, but I am working on prioritizing what needs to be done. Now more than ever timeboxing has been a big help. By starting off a challenge and specifying how much time I intend to work on each release I've set myself up to complete my required workload with ample time left over to chase the tangents.</p>

              <p>If having a particular thinking style wasn't enough to wrap your head around, try to imagine that we also have different mindsets. I wont go into explaining the difference because that in itself is a fun read growth vs. fixed mindset. I will say this, how can you know what you need to know if you don't know what you don't know? Say what? Exactly. What I mean by that is if you aren't actively maintaining a grow mindset you'll miss out on all the things out there that you never knew about. Even here in phase-0, we're actively learning new things, but every one of these topics goes so much deeper and there's so much more information out there that we might not even know exists yet. So question everything, research everything, and yes chase the tangents! Accept that you'll never stop learning and frankly you should never want to because for every one thing you learn there will be two more unanswered questions.</p>
