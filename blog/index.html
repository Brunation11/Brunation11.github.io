              <p>You never realize how much you actually know until you stumble across something new. It’s week-7 of DBC and we just got our first taste of JavaScript. Having a good foundation in Ruby helped immensely with the logic. It’s like I said, you don’t realize how much you know until you stumble across something new, and JavaScript was definitely something new.</p>

              <p>In Ruby concepts are often defined through data structures known as classes. They are collections of all the attributes and methods their concepts have. Even our dog has been given a name, age, and color attribute.</p>

              <p>So no joke, there I was, week-5 of DBC winding down and it seemed like it was only a week ago that we got started with Ruby. Of course that may just be because it was only one short week ago that we had our introduction to Ruby.</p>

              <p>For must of us here at DBC this will be our first time stepping into the tech world and while everything still seems fresh and new there will come a time where, at least in the eyes of our clients, we will be considered experts in our fields. No pressure right? We’ll be expected to sit in on meetings, counted on to articulate our visions, and presumed to be able to craft any request regardless of how obscure it may seem.  But through it all it’s quite easy to forget that the reason why we became developers in the first place was to create beautiful and meaningful things. We owe it to users everywhere to steer our clients on the path towards providing the best user experience.</p>

              <p>As we progress further into phase-0 of DBC we've reach object oriented programming using Ruby. What a lot of you may not know is that programming does't only deal with objects on an individual bases but often with entire collections. We iterate through these collections, organizing them, specifying critieria for objects we want to retrieve or those we want to exclude. With so many possible operations, accessing all this information becomes key, pun intended. Don't worry if you didn't get it, you will by the end of this post.</p>

              <p>So it turns out that when timeboxing is suggested on a challenge it would be wise to listen. My journey into CSS was a roller-coaster of a time, it had it's ups and it had its downs but at the end of this week I'm excited to see all the possibilities that come with CSS.</p>

              <p>So phase-0 has been everything I've expected it to be and more. I've been inspired, motivated, challenged and utterly defeated. I've found myself humbled by my peers and everything that we've been able to learn from one another. Frankly, I'm humbled by just how much I don't know... That isn't to say that I'm not enjoying the experience, on the contrary, in today's day and age it's difficult to find this kind of stimuli. I would even go as far as to say that my biggest struggle is in processing all the information that's been thrown at me. I go off on tangents about 90% of the time, no really that's not an exaggeration, but that's because for the first time in a long time I've found myself in an environment conducive to my style of thinking.</p>

              <p>Let me start off by saying that a few short hours ago I wouldn’t have given Version Control, VC for short, the time of day. After creating a new repo in my home path two days ago, running my bash profile through the wood chipper TWICE yesterday because that new repo changed what my shell prompt looked like, and deleting and recreating my repos on GitHub multiple times today because I'm just too stubborn for my own good, I've decided to give into the process.</p>
