      Let me start off by saying that a few short hours ago I wouldnt have given Version Control, or VC for short, the time of day. After creating a new repo in my home path two days ago, running my bash_profile through the woodchipper TWICE yesterday because that new repo changed what my shell prompt looked like, and deleting and recreating my repos on GitHub multiple times today because I'm just too smart for my own good, I've decided to give into the process.
