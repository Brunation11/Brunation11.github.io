      Let me start off by saying that a few short hours ago I wouldnt have given Version Control, or VC for short, the time of day. After creating a new repo in my home path two days ago, running my bash_profile through the woodchipper TWICE yesterday because that new repo changed what my shell prompt looked like, and deleting and recreating my repos on GitHub multiple times today because I'm just too smart for my own good, I've decided to give into the process.

      Maybe you're reading this and asking yourself "What is this guy talking about?" If you are dont worry it was only two days ago that I was asking myself the very same thing. So what am I talking about? Version Control of course! VC is a system of recording changes to a file or files as your working so that you can recall specific versions later. I read this analogy in one of the resources from an earlier challange. Imagine being able to make as many copies of yourself as you want, and each of these versions exists in a parallel universe all at the same time. Now wait for it, this is where it gets good. Now imagine that in each of these parallel universes all existing at the same time you could act out your life however you'd like until you decide it was perfect, and if you for some reason decide that one of your other selves from another parallel universe was somehow better now you could choose that one instead. Version Control, it's that simple!
