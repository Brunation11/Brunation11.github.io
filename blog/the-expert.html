            <br>
            <p>For must of us here at DBC this will be our first time stepping into the tech world and while everything still seems fresh and new there will come a time where, at least in the eyes of our clients, we will be considered experts in our fields. No pressure right? We’ll be expected to sit in on meetings, counted on to articulate our visions, and presumed to be able to craft any request regardless of how obscure it may seem.  But through it all it’s quite easy to forget that the reason why we became developers in the first place was to create beautiful and meaningful things. We owe it to users everywhere to steer our clients on the path towards providing the best user experience.</p>

            <p>A little over a year ago, a short video titled “The Expert” made head lines in tech groups. The satirical video, which runs approximately seven minutes and thirty-five seconds, chronicles an amusingly infuriating meeting between a tech consultant and a client and exposes a scenario that all too often still happens today. What happens when a client makes what they believe to be a reasonable request and an “expert” armed only with technical jargon tries to articulate all the reasons a request isn’t possible? Though through its entirety the focus remains on the technical impossibility of the request and one topic is never considered, what will give the end user the best experience?</p>

            <p>What “The Expert” seeks to expose are actually very common issues in a typical meeting. Such issues as, who actually has the final say in what technology is designed, who decides what functions are built, and more importantly who is allowed to attend design discussions, and should the topics of technology and design be exclusive to technical experts? From an expert’s perspective, a client’s request can sometimes seem bizarre and it’s often difficult to fathom how a client doesn’t see how impractical their request really is. Clients on the other hand view this predicament in quite the opposite. They perceive what seems like a reasonable request that is shot down at every turn by some expert reciting technical verbiage, annoyed, difficult, and condescending.</p>

            <p>The reality is that using proper language to bridge the gap between client and technical expert is a job in itself. For my fellow cohorts and I, it would be too easy to claim a lack of knowledge as someone just entering the tech field. To say that the honest truth is that we as aspiring Jr. Developers just don’t know enough about designing for the user experience to chime in on what our users deserve. In fact, in doing so we would be following suite, walking in the footsteps of web masters and developers who’ve come before us. It’s why UX design is a growing field in itself.</p>

            <p>With years of experience it becomes almost impossible to remember what it was once like to not be an expert and be able to use our technical knowhow to guide our non-technical clients.  Yes the job of bridging this gap belongs to the UX designer but the responsibility of expert and client first and foremost is to the end user. As developers our sole purpose should be to create beautiful and meaningful things, not because of aesthetics but because they are created with the user experience in mind. “The expert” roots its groundwork on the idea that technology and design should be left to technical experts but gone are the days where design conversations are based on technical impossibilities. Clients will continue to make unreasonable requests. It will be our job to choose how we respond and drive the focus towards the user experience.</p>
