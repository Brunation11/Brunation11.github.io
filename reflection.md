#3.5 My Website, part 3

##A [work](brunation11.github.io/index.html/ "Title") in progress.

So it turns out that when timeboxing is suggested on a challenge it would be wise to listen. My journey into CSS was a roller-coaster of a time, it had it's ups and it had its downs but coming out of this challenge I'm excited to see how this project will progress with time.

###What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

I came into this challenge with a very small bit of CSS knowledge. Not necessarily in the syntax but rather the concept of the CSS Box Model. The CSS Box Model is a representation of the relationship between margins, borders, padding and the actual content. This challenge helped immensely in putting that theory into practice and learning first hand how each one works in relation to one another and the objects around them.

###What did you learn about CSS positioning?

CSS positioning is something I still have much to learn about. The previous pair challenge with positioning was an excellent primer for implementing CSS in this challenge. Going off of my wireframe designs helped me understand how the different positioning values effect the interaction of objects on a page.

###What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

The easiest aspect of my design to implement was the sidebar containing the navigation. Primarily because once I created the sidebar and placed it where I wanted I focused on treating that container as the only area my objects moved in. By limiting this area establishing meaningful relationships between content became much easier. The most difficult aspect was keeping elements from becoming after thoughts.

###What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

The easiest way I can answer this is to say that when it comes to CSS less is more. Donâ€™t specify things simply to undo them later on. I also learned that when my style sheet felt finished, that looking over it I was always able to simplify and eliminate some lines without effecting the desired style.
